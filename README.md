# Swiftracer
Simple ray-tracing renderer written in Swift, based on the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/). I highly recommend this book!

Contains implementations until the end of Chapter 8 of the book on shadows.

## What's in this repositotry?


**SwiftRayTracer** - The renderer written as a Swift package

**Swiftracer-macOS** - macOS app using the renderer package to render a simple scene


## Running the project

All you need to do is open *Swiftracer-macOS/Swiftracer-macOS.xcodeproj* and run. Xcode will automatically load the SwiftRayTracer package's code alongside the project.
